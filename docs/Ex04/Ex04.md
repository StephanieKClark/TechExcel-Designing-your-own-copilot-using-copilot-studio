# Exercise 04: Make HTTP requests to connect to an API

Connecting to data provides companies with some of the most benefits as it provides information and insight to users that is up to date and often the relevant for customer or user questions.
 	
In this task, you will go through creating a new topic, adding a simple HTTP Request node action to retrieve information from an external service, and display that data back to the user.

## Goals for this lab

After this lab you will be able to:
- Understand the basics of the HTTP Request node
- Use Copilot Studio to request data from another data source using HTTP node in a basic use case (using the Gemini) and return the data in a conversational dialog with a customer or user
