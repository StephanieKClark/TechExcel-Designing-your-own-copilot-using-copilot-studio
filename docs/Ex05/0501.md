>**Pro tips**:  
    - When using the default built-in natural language understanding model, knowledge sources are invoked from the Create generative answers node. By default, user sentences that donâ€™t trigger a topic will go to the Conversational boosting topic, where a generative answers node is pre-configured.  
    - When generative AI orchestration is enabled, the large language model will look at each knowledge source model description to know what data source to use to answer a user query.
