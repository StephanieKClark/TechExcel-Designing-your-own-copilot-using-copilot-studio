# Task 07: Configuring a SharePoint knowledge source

1.	Navigate to the **Knowledge** tab of your copilot and select **Add knowledge**.

2.	Select **SharePoint and OneDrive**, and use this URL: **[https://m365x01845910.sharepoint.com/sites/Mark8ProjectTeam](https://m365x01845910.sharepoint.com/sites/Mark8ProjectTeam)**. Change m365x01845910 to your actual M365 subscription.

	- Give it a description `Answer`

3.	Because **SharePoint and OneDrive** are internal data sources, end-users have to be authenticated. If itâ€™s not the case, go to **Settings**, **Security**, **Authentication**, choose **Authenticate with Microsoft**, then **Save**.

    >{: . important }
    >**Pro tip**:
    >This data source requires authentication because any search is done in the context of the connected end-user. So, only documents and pages the end-user has at least read access to are returned and summarized.
