# Task 07: Configuring a SharePoint knowledge source

1.	Navigate to the **Knowledge** tab of your copilot and select **Add knowledge**.

1.	Select **SharePoint and OneDrive**, and use this URL: **[https://m365x01845910.sharepoint.com/sites/Mark8ProjectTeam](https://m365x01845910.sharepoint.com/sites/Mark8ProjectTeam)**. Change m365x01845910 to your actual M365 subscription.

	- Give it a description **Answer**

1.	Because **SharePoint and OneDrive** are internal data sources, end-users have to be authenticated. If itâ€™s not the case, go to **Settings**, **Security**, **Authentication**, choose **Authenticate with Microsoft**, then **Save**.

{: .important }
> This data source requires authentication because any search is done in the context of the connected end-user. So, only documents and pages the end-user has at least read access to are returned and summarized.

{: .note }
> It may take about 30 minutes for Copilot to index the data in the SharePoint site.

1. After configuring the knowledge source, you must publish your copilot to make it available in Teams:

   1. Download the app package (ZIP file) from Microsoft Copilot Studio. You can find this in the **Channels** tab by selecting the **Download app** option. 
   2. Open Microsoft Teams and navigate to the **Apps** section.
   3. Select **Upload a custom app** and upload the downloaded ZIP file.
   4. Assign the app to the appropriate Teams channel or users.
