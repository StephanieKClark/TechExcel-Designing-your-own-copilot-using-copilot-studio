 	Now that you've reviewed an existing topic, you can move on to the next task to create a new topic.

    >{: . important }	**Pro tips**: Click on a message in the test pane to get redirected to the exact topic and node it was used in. When in a topic, you can access the variables values (e.g., the selected store location) in the Variables menu. Within this menu, the Test tab displays the current value at run time. ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](instructions271830\Media01\16e1af56e7a7fbdf562121dd8bf7ecac.png)
