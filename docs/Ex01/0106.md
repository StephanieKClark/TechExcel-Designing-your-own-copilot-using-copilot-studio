# Publish your copilot to the demo website for testing

## Task 6.1: Change your copilot authentication

1.	Go to **Settings** in the top-right navigation.

2.	Go to **Security**.

3.	Select **Authentication**.

4.	Select **No authentication** in the panel that opens, then select **Save**.

5.	In the **Save this configuration?** Panel that opens, select **Save**.

#### Task 6.2: Publish your copilot

Microsoft Copilot Studio provides a demo website so that you can invite anyone to test your copilot by sending them the URL. This demo website is useful for gathering feedback to improve your content before you activate the copilot for your real end-users.

1.	In Microsoft Copilot Studio, go to the **Channels** tab.

2.	Select **Publish** to push the latest topics updates to the demo website.

	- You will need to complete this action before using the demo website for the first time and after making any changes to the topics you want users to test.

	> - When you've created your real copilot, you'll publish whenever you want to make updated topics available in your deployed channels.

	>
	> - Publication should take only a **few minutes**.

After you've selected the Publish option, a green banner notification will show at the top of the screen when publishing is complete.
