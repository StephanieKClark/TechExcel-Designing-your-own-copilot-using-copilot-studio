# Task 6: Create a condition by using variables

In this task, you'll create a condition based on the three variable options that were used in the custom entity in the first exercise.

1.	In your authoring canvas, under the **Message** node that you modified in the previous task, select the plus (+) icon to add a new node and then select **Add a condition**.

2.	Two new nodes will appear, one is your **Condition** and the other is an exception for **All other conditions**.

 	In your **Condition** node, select the **Select a variable** option and then select your **OrderRequest** global variable.

3.	Keep the condition operator as **is equal to** and then select the empty box beneath to display the three available options from the selected variable. Select the **Update** option â€“ make sure you click on the *Enter or select a value* part, and not on the chevron icon (>).

4.	A completed condition should now show: if the **OrderRequest** is equal to **Update**.

5.	Create two more conditions in this branch for the two other options for the **OrderRequest** variable (check and cancel). Select the plus **(+)** icon to add a node above the condition and then select **Add a condition** to add another conditional branch.

6.	Repeat the previous steps by selecting your **Global.OrderRequest** variable and then select the **Check** and **Cancel** options in two other conditions so that you'll have a conditional branch with three options (including **All Other Conditions**), as shown in the following screenshot.

7.	Under each condition node, add a **Message** node that will display different text depending on the condition, as shown in the following example.

	+++One moment, I will update your order for you.+++

    >{: . important }	**Pro tip**: do things faster by selecting a node and copying it with the top-left productivity tools menu. Once copied, the node gets available to be pasted, using the same productivity tools menu or when using the (+) icon to add a new node.

1.	**Save** your topic and then select the **Test** option to explore the different trigger phrases and conditions that lead the user to view different message outcomes.

Conditions are foundational tools that help you create tailored experiences based on what the user has selected or answered in previous questions. You can nest conditions within other conditions for more complex logic.


Congratulations, you've now completed the basics of using conditions and using variables as parameters within them.

#Use topic nodes

Microsoft Copilot Studio allows authors to redirect to another topic, such as an escalation topic. Typically, topics are set up to trigger based on what users are typing or saying to the Copilot that triggers an intent match, or based on events such as an escalation, conversation start, and other system topics with event-driven triggers. Users can also direct other topics within an authored conversation where it makes sense to do so, or they can perform loops within the current topic to another node.
