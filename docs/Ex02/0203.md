# Testing slot filling

3.	Display the Test pane.

4.	Use the refresh button to start a new conversation.

5.	Try out how entities and slot filling work by entering a sentence matching one of your trigger phrases.

	+++Can I check on an order?+++

1.	Go the to Check Order Status topic, and display the Variables pane, and in the Test tab, expand the Topic variables.
 	
	 You will observe the process working because the user has triggered this topic with the intent to "check" an order, and the entity has been slot filled into the variable from the follow-up question after the trigger phrase. **As a result, the question isn't asked and is skipped**. This is because you've used entities and slot filling to retrieve the information from utterance the user submitted. This approach avoids you needing to ask the user a question that they've already provided information for.

# Variables
 	
You're beginning to enhance the topic that you created in the previous lab. In the previous section, you used entities and slot filling to automatically detect the data from a user's sentence and store specific data in a variable. Now, you'll learn how to use the data that you obtained from the question in a variable and then display it within a message.
