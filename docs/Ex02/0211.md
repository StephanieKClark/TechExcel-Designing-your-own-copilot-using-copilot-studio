# Task 11: Use Power Fx to modify how the date is displayed

Follow these steps to use Power Fx to modify how the date is displayed.

1.	Open the **Check Order Status** topic that you've been working with during these labs.

6.	Under the **Check** condition branch, add **Set a variable value** node, and choose **Create a new variable**.

7.	Selecting the new variable opens the **Variable properties** window to the right. Change the name of the variable to +++OrderDeliveryDate+++.

8.	On the **Set variable value** node, under **To Value**, select the flyout menu and then select **Formula** to open the **Enter formula** panel. Optionally, you can select the **expand** icon at the top-right of the **Enter formula** window to enlarge the area for entering a formula, and paste the below one.

8.	In the formula bar, enter the following function and then select **Insert**, as follows:

	```
	Text(
		DateAdd(
			Now(),
			2,
			TimeUnit.Days
		),
		DateTimeFormat.LongDate
	)
	```

	- This function takes today's date and time, which technically has a specific date and time format (e.g., 5/31/2024 8:00 AM), adds 2 days to it, and then formats it in a long date format (e.g., Friday, May 31, 2024). This approach is important if you want to display simple date formats that are user-friendly or if you want to store the date as a string, in text format.

1.	For demo purposes, you can update the last Message in the Check path, to use the news variables you have configured:

	+++Your order {Topic.OrderNumber} should be delivered by {Topic.OrderDeliveryDate}.+++

1.	**Save**.

2.	Test your Copilot by opening the testing pane, trigger the topic, and then follow the topic prompts to reach your **Message** node, as shown in the following screenshot.

	+++Hello, can you please check the status of my order ORD-001342?+++
