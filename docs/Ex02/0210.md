## Use Power Fx across Microsoft Copilot Studio

Power Fx is available in Microsoft Copilot Studio. With Power Fx, you can add functions, similar to how makers currently do in canvas apps from Microsoft Power Apps or Dataverse within the Microsoft Copilot Studio authoring canvas. You can use Power Fx in **Message** and **Question** nodes, when you're using the **Set a variable** value node, and in other areas such as **Conditions**, **Actions**, **Question behavior** configuration and **Adaptive Cards**. This feature gives you greater control over the data that's displayed to customers and users within the conversational interface. Additionally, it allows you to perform common operations in the runtime of Microsoft Copilot Studio.
 	
The following task goes through a basic scenario of using Power Fx within a variable and then displaying the value to the user.
