# Task 01: Enable generative AI orchestration

1.	Go to **Settings** and to the **Generative AI** options.

2.	In **How should your copilot decide how to respond?** select **Generative**, then **Save**. (This diagram is outdated and we now have 3 options)

# Actions

When you turn on generative mode, your copilot can automatically select the most appropriate action or topic, to respond to a user at runtime. In classic mode, a copilot can only use topics to respond to the user. However, you can still design your copilot to call actions explicitly from within topics.

Actions are based on one of the following core action types:

  - Prebuilt connector action

  - Custom connector action

  - Power Automate cloud flow

  - AI Builder prompts

  - Bot Framework skill

Each core action has additional information that describes its purpose, allowing the copilot to use generative AI to generate questions. These questions are required to fill the inputs needed to perform the action. Therefore, you don't need to manually author question nodes to gather all inputs needed, such as the inputs on a flow. Inputs are handled for you during runtime.

Actions can generate a contextual response to a user's query, using the results of the action. Alternatively, you can explicitly author a response for the action.
