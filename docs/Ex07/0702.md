# Task 2: Create a prompt

1. Go to **Topics**, and open **Check Ticket Status**.

	{: .note }
	> Our goal is to use Generative AI to draft a letter to the user based on the issue raised in the ServiceNow ticket

1. After the **last message** that contained an Adaptive Card, add **another node** with the (+) button.

	{: .note }
	> After pressing the (+) button, the + changes to an X as shown. Choose **Call an action** and select **Create a prompt** (view screenshot below).

1. In the Prompt, paste the below instructions:

   ```
   Based on the ticket details, write a pesonalized apologetic message to the person impacted. You can summarize the issue to show you understand it. Show empathy and suggest ways to mitigate the situation based on the ticket details. Have a positive attitude and use emojis when applicable. Don't include hashtags. Text should be a single paragraph.
   ```
1. Add the text **## Ticket Details** at the bottom of the new text.

1. **Under** the **## Ticket details** section, use the **Insert** button to select the **Details** input.

1. Under **Settings**, choose **Model GPT-4o**.

1. Select **Save custom prompt**.

1. Select the **SNTicketInfo** variable for the **Details input**.
