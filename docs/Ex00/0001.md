# Task 01: Add on a trial of Power Platform

{: .important }
> For those who are building a demo environment using CDX, you can start with a 90 day M365. Start by going to **cdx.transform.microsoft.com** and select **My Environments**. Click **create tenant** and then open an In Private browser, sign in with the new credentials and activate MFA.  Consult your instructor if you need support.

{: .note }
> Since the hosted lab will have credentials for M365 including sample data and SharePoint sites, you can skip to the next step if you are in a Skillable Lab environment.

1.	Stay in your In Private browser window. Open a new browser tab and enter: 
    ```
    aka.ms/ppac
    ```
    
    {: .note }
    > This will retain your M365 account Identity and carry it over to the Power Platform which is the foundation on which Copilot Studio is built.
    >
    > This is also where Copilot Studio will store data associated with your Custom Copilot.

1.	Letâ€™s use the **contoso(default)** Power Platform environment by clicking on the link. Then click the link to **add Dataverse**.  You will need to wait until the status changes to **ready**

    

    {: .important }
    > You can also create Flows and Actions that Copilot can leverage. You can even use Power Platform connectors as a way for our Copilots to access outside data from customer apps, document sources and their own databases.



1.	Back on the **Add Dataverse** screen turn on **Deploy sample apps and data**.
