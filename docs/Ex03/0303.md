# Task 3: Call your Power Automate cloud flow from Copilot Studio

1.	Open your existing topic in Copilot Studio and go back to the bottom of your flow, as shown below. Click **Call an action**, and you should see your brand new Power Automate cloud flow in the list under the **Basic actions** tab. From the list, select your **Get Ticket Status** flow.

    >{: . important }	**Pro tip**: If you don’t see the cloud flow you’ve created, **Save** the topic, and **refresh** the page to try again.

1.	When you select your **Get Ticket Status** flow, you will see a new Action node is automatically added.

	- If the flow requires an input, it requests the value to be selected. As the flow you created in the previous steps requires the **TicketNumber** input, we need to add this input into the Power Automate action by selecting the variable the value is stored in from the user, which is **TicketNumber** from the previous steps earlier in the lab.

2.	Select **Enter or select a value** and choose your **TicketNumber** variable you created in the previous steps of this lab. This is now connected to the Power Automate flow, and outputs the result from Power Automate into the **SNTicketInfo** variable.

    >{: . important }	**Pro tips**: 
	- If a latency is expected from your integration, go the action’s properties and add a Latency Message, for example: +++I’m getting these details for you. Hold on…+++ 
	- Consider using HTTP requests and connectors directly in Microsoft Copilot Studio to avoid the added latency of invoking and running a cloud flow in Power Automate.

1.	As **ServiceNow** will return the full details of the incident in a technical, **JSON**, format, you need to parse it so that Copilot Studio fully understand its content based on its schema.

	- To do this, select **Variable management**, and then **Parse value**.
 	![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](instructions271830\Media01\c28b821fc07a4e0cb0497d88258632ab.png)

	To parse the JSON you can use the Rest API Explorer in ServiceNow to get the structure of the body, or get the schema from a sample payload. For the lab, we’re providing sample ServiceNow data below.

    >{: . important }	If you struggle copying the below text, go to +++F:\LabFiles\Misc+++ and open the ServiceNow Sample JSON Payload.txt

1.	Now we will need to select the value to parse by selecting the **SNTicketInfo** variable from the Power Automate flow action.

2.	Next we will select the **Data type** to **From sample data**.

3.	Now paste in the JSON sample provided in the above steps from, after selecting **Get schema from sample JSON** and select **Confirm**.

**

4.	Then set a variable to store the parsed record for later user.

	- Create a variable called +++SNTicketInfoParsed+++. Its type will automatically be set based on its schema (record).

5.	Now, add a response to give the user of your copilot a formatted response to tell them the status of the ticket. 

	- Click the **(+)** to add a new node and select **Send a message**.

	- Bold the key information either with the command bar or by surrounding the text with **.

	+++The status of ticket {Topic.TicketNumber} ({Topic.SNTicketInfoParsed.short_description}) is {Topic.SNTicketInfoParsed.state}+++


    >{: . important }	**Pro tip**: Copilot Studio and some channels support [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for simple formatting.

	You can look above at the sample JSON to see what data would be returned in what value, however below is a screenshot of the ticket we will lookup later to help you with structuring your message:

1.	To end the conversation, select **Topic management** and **Go to another topic** and select **End of Conversation**.

2.	**Save** your topic and **test** your copilot.

1. Enter the following prompt:

	+++What is the status of my ticket INC0007001?+++

1.	Make sure you check the status of ticket number **INC0007001**:

 	You have successfully created a Power Automate cloud flow and a new topic in Microsoft Copilot Studio that used the flow to provide real time data from an external service to the user!
